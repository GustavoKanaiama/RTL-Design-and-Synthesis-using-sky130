# RTL-Design-and-Synthesis-using-sky130
Welcome to the “RTL Design and Synthesis using Sky130” workshop a hands-on learning series by VSD-IAT focused on Verilog RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and digital circuit optimization. Designed especially for electronics and VLSI enthusiasts, this 10-day workshop offers a step-by-step introduction to the ASIC frontend design flow using 100% open-source EDA tools.

The workshop is structured into daily modules, each featuring practical labs, code examples, and detailed explanations. Participants will learn how to write RTL code, run simulations, perform synthesis, and carry out gate-level analysis using the Sky130 open-source PDK developed by Google and SkyWater Foundry. The entire flow mirrors real-world industry practices, making it a valuable experience for anyone looking to build a strong foundation in digital and ASIC design.
